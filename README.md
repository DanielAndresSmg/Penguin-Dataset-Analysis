# Penguin-Dataset-Analysis

There are several tasks that define the workflow of CRISP - DM. This tax was obtained from the Startup Campus MBKM Independent Study.

| Exercise | About |

|[Exercesi 5](https://github.com/DanielAndresSmg/Penguin-Dataset-Analysis/blob/main/Exercise_5.ipynb)| Actionable Insight and Storytelling|

A little information, I got these exercises from my training at the MSIB Startup Campus. For the plot itself, it is always updated from the results of the answers they give.

# About Dataset
![image](https://github.com/DanielAndresSmg/Penguin-Dataset-Analysis/blob/main/penguin_species.png)

**The dataset consists of 7 columns :**
| Column | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| species | Penguin species (Chinstrap, Ad√©lie, or Gentoo)|
| culmen_length_mm | Culmen length (mm) |
| culmen_depth_mm | Culmen depth (mm) |
| flipper_length_mm | Flipper length (mm) |
| body_mass_g | Body mass (g) |
| island | Island name (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe) in the Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) |
| sex | Penguin sex |

**Note :**
- Column length & depth is "the upper ridge of a bird's beak"
- Penguins wings are called flippers. They are flat, thin, and broad with a long, tapered shape and a blunt, rounded tip
